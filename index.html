        Hobbies
      I have a variety of hobbies, to do with sports, games and video games. I play for a football team called CFA, and I play football at lunchtime with friends.<br><br>
      For video games, I like playing minecraft, rocket league and Fifa on my cousins PS4. I used to enjoy playing Pokemon GO, but the trend has stopped.<br><br>
      When im at my cousins house, we used to enjoy playing Hide and Seek, but there isn'y much hype for playing it because there isn't much unkown hiding spots.<br><br> Because of that, we play hide in the dark.<br>
      The rules for hide in the dark is that you can't throw stuff, you can't touch whoever is it, you have to cover your eyes and finally if you have been touched, you are it next.
